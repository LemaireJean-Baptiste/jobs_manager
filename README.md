# Jobs Manager website

This website is developped in PHP using the microframework slim: http://www.slimframework.com/

It is a recruitment management plateform developped for my school society.
It was made to automatize the recruitement process.

I don't have the time anymore to maintain this website. The UX design and the code are homemade (except for the packages used which belongs to their respective author). Everything which is not already owned by the author of the packages and the framework is open-sourced. (No restrictions, of any kind, is attached to the reuse of this work.)
